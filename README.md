# India-State-District-Geojson-with-Leaflet
This project is an interactive web application that displays the map of India using state.js, a JavaScript library containing the GeoJSON data for all Indian states. The application utilizes the Leaflet library to provide a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

Interactive Map: Users can click on any state on the India map to view detailed information about that specific state.
State Visualization: When a state is clicked, the remaining states are automatically hidden, providing a clear focus on the selected state's boundary.
District Information: The application loads the district-level GeoJSON data for the selected state and overlays it on the map, providing a more granular view of the state's districts.
Leaflet Integration: The Leaflet library is used to render the map, handle user interactions, and display the GeoJSON data.
